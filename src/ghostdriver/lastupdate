    Ignore page load failures initiated by Click action.
    
    If the click finishes, it's finished.
    The fact that the expected destination page didn't load it's irrelevant.
    
    This implies that, in case a "onLoadFinished" occurred
    but resulting "status === 'fail'" we have to ignore it.
    
    This is how Chrome and Firefox Drivers seem to behaveâ€¦
    
    Fixes #202.
