    Schedule the pageLoadNotTriggered timer *after* script execution.
    
    If the target function loads the page, then this will be completed by the
    time pageLoadNotTriggered is scheduled. So the effect is to make
    _execFuncAndWaitForLoadDecorator more deterministic (since any synchronous
    loading will definitely be detected and handled correctly).
    
    Tidy up comments:
    * Clarify some of the circumstances in which onErrorFunc might be called.
    * Fix mistakes in comment.
